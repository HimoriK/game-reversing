## Picking the right tools

Before getting to work on a game you must know your target, so it's important to gather some information such as:
- What software technologies it uses
- What programming language and compiler it had been developed with
- Does it have any anti-reversing technology in place
- What engine is it running?

Similiar engines often use the same tools. For 3rd game engines such as Unreal Engine or Unity there are a lot of custom tools online that can ease the process of reverse engineering.

Games coded with interpreted programming languages such as C# or Java are much easier to reverse engineer as compared to C/C++, due to the metadata not being lost as they aren't compiled into low-level machine code.

For Unity-based games (and for any other games developed with the .Net Framework) use dnSpy instead of IDA/Ghidra.

Focus on reversing games coded in C++ as it's still the gold standard. (Tech Tax, no company can escape the C curse)

- Examples of games made with C++:
    - Counter-Strike
    - Grand Theft Auto V
    - Fortnite
    - World of Warcraft
    - Fallout 4
    - Destiny 2

- Examples of games made with C#:
    - Genshin Impact
    - Beat Saber
    - Rust
    - RimWorld
    - Hollow Knight
    - Cuphead
